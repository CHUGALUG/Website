<h2>SQL Basics</h2>
<p>Date: December 17th, 2009</p>

<p><a href="http://www.brandonchecketts.com.com/">Brandon Checketts</a> gave a presentation starting with some basics of SQL and built up to some more complicated queries.</p>

<p>It started out with a simple table for kids who were either naughty or nice.  We then added some reports to that.   Then imported kids' wish lists from CSV files.  From there we were able to generate some manufacturing reports for the workshop.  </p>

<p>When we joined the wish list table with the kids table, we were then able to generate a sleigh-loading report which included only gifts for kids who had been good.   Then we got even more complicated and introduced several joins with some complicated mathematics to select gifts for kids within a certain radius from a given zip code.</p>

<p>The presentation is <a href="/downloads/CHUGALUG Chrsitmas SQL.ppt">available for download here</a>.  And Brian recorded part of the presentation which is available to view <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/3205751">on uStream.tv</a> or here. (We're still experimenting with getting the video recording set up correctly)</p>
