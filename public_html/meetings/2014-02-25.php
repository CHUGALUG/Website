<h2>Organizational Meeting</h2>
<p>Date: Feb. 25, 2014</p>

<p>
This was our first meeting on the new day (fourth Tuesdays rather than third
Thursdays), so we talked about things we might like to do.  A link to the
meeting notes was posted to the Facebook group and to the mailing list.  The
biggest procedural change we decided on was that we would have two topics 
each night.  One would be a general, introductory topic.  The second would be
an advanced topic relevant to the first.  This is, essentially, how meetings
were already supposed to go.  All we've done is to formalize the initial bits.  
There was also discussion of having a short course in Linux and of having 
an additional, less formal meeting each month that would occur, for example,
in a pub (with food so under-21's can join).  We also decided on the contents
of the next meeting. These will be announced soon.
