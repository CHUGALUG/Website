<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">ssh</a>
 is one of the most useful tools in the linux  toolkit, but it is often not used to its full potential.  Bob will start with the basics, and move through to more advanced usage, focusing on the practical uses of ssh.  Including:

<ul>
<li> basic usage and configuration
<li> key/agent management
<li> port forwarding and proxying
<li> remote execution and control
</ul>

This is targeted for people that have a basic knowledge of ssh, but veteran users might be surprised to find a new trick here and there.    Some things you may learn:

<ul>
<li> how to stop typing passwords
<li> how to securely automate backups
<li> how to circumvent annoying firewalls
<li> how to speed up multiple persistent connections
</ul>
