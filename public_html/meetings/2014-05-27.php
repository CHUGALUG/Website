<b>The Hotrodder's Guide to Maximum Performance LAMP</b>

Hotrods, aka drag racers, are the automotive epitome of the pursuit of maximum performance. Even though they are amazing machines, the basic concepts of how to get there are simple: reduce weight, simplify, streamline, and add power. The same concepts can be applied to server infrastructure to take your overloaded server and have it burn rubber. Even in an age of abundant CPU power and cloud computing, the art of tuning servers for maximum performance is still relevant and pays immense dividends down the road no matter what size your IT infrastructure is.
