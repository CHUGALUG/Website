<u>Introductory topic:</u>
<br></br>
<b>What can new users do with Linux?</b> 
<br>Lachele Foley</br>

This first part of the evening will focus on Linux applications that are 
appropriate for beginners.  I'll also give some tips on finding out what 
a Linux box can do.
<br></br>
<u>Advanced topic:</u>
<br></br>
<b>What can advanced users do with Linux?</b>

</br>
Although Linux has made great progress in becoming an operating 
system for ordinary users, it is still the OS of choice for many 
advanced and professional users.  The second part of the talk will
focus on advanced uses.

Advanced users are especially encouraged to attend this meeting and to
share with the newer folks what they use Linux for.
