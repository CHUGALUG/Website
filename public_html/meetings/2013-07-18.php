<p>Brian Whigham gave a great talk about <a href="http://www.usg.edu/peachnet/cloud/vdc">PeachNet Cloud Services</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
USG offers cloud services to member schools.  See a quick overview of PeachNet Cloud Storage, an S3 compatible storage service, as well as PeachNet Backups.  We'll go in-depth on using PeachNet Virtual Data Center to offload a little or a lot of your datacenter.  The virtual datacenter is currently backed by VMware's Virtual Cloud Director.  Customers define vApps, virtual machines, networks and firewall rules according to their needs.  It's inexpensive enough to use as a failover web server and robust enough to tackle Oracle databases and applications like Banner.  It's all built on some of the best hardware on the market. Try it for free.
