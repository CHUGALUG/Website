<!-- In July, Brandon Checketts will be giving us a Brief Introduction to Security

He'll discuss some security and authentication schemes for various protocols (Email, Web, FTP, etc) and show why they are either bad or good. He'll discuss some ways to enhance security if you are an administrator or programmer, and some ways to identify and become more security conscious if you are a user. He might even hijack somebody's Facebook account to demonstrate why this is a concern.
