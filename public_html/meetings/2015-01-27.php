<b>What is GIS?</b> 
<br>Randal Hale</br>
</br>
Geographic Information Systems is the combination of data, software, and an operator to provide a look at that data geographically. Data is usually put into layers and compared to other data. To quote Waldo Tobler:  "Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things." In this first talk we will go over the science of GIS and how it has it's roots in Open Source.

<b>Introduction to OpenStreetMap</b> 
<br>Randal Hale</br>
</br>
It's often been called the wikipedia of maps. OSM (OpenStreetMap) allows anyone to make edits to a worldwide map. You are also free to use that data to make your own map. Technically - it's not even a map - it's a giant database that is freely accessible. We will cover the origins of OSM, How to contribute, and how to download the data. It runs on any platform (Linux is the backbone). It is quite fun and addicting once you get started.
