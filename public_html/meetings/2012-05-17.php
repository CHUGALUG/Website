<b>Advancing in the Bash Shell</b>
<blockquote> 
If you've ever used GNU/Linux, chances are good that you've used bash. Some people hold the belief that using a GUI is faster than using a CLI. These people have obviously never seen someone who uses a shell proficiently. In this talk, I hope to show you just a few of the amazing features bash provides that will increase your productivity in the shell.
