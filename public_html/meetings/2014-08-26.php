<h2>What should we do this year, and how will we do it?</h2>
<p>Date: Aug. 26, 2014</p>

<p>
About 5 of us showed up, and we had a useful, productive and entertaining chat
about the things the group might want to do this year.  We also discussed ways
to go about doing them.
</p>
<p>
This was the original meeting announcement:
</p>
<u>Introductory topic:</u>
<br></br>
<b>What should we do this year?</b> 
<br>Everyone</br>
</br>
We'll spend the first part of the meeting talking about the things we would like to 
see CHUGALUG do this coming year.  For example, are there specific topics or 
speakers people would like to see?  Are there any activities they would like to do?
<br></br>
<u>Advanced topic:</u>
<br></br>
<b>How are we going to do it?</b> 
<br>Everyone</br>
</br>
We'll spend the second part of the meeting figuring out how we are going to do those
things.  We'll not only discuss timetables, but also locations and other logistics, such
as finding speakers for certain topics.
