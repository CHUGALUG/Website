<p>David Millians gave a great talk about building portable apps.</p>

<b>Building Portable Apps: The Easy* Way</b>
</br>
<blockquote>
With the rise of portable apps, whether on Android, iOS, or other niche platforms, has come a need for programmers. If the thought of learning another language, or supporting far too many devices, scares you, come see how wrappers like Phonegap can make app writing *almost* as simple as writing javascript, css, and HTML. If a neophyte like me can do it, you surely can!
