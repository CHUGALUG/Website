<h2>JavaScript and Node.js</h2>
<p>Date: Apr. 19, 2012</p>

<p>Semmy Purewal gave a great presentation on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript/">JavaScript</a>  
and
<a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>  

If you would like to find out more, you can 
<a href="">check out his github for the project</a>.
The repo includes a Vagrantfile and a set of Chef cookbooks to build a
node/redis/mongodb server.  It includes examples from the talk so you
can easily play around with them.

<b>JavaScript and Node.js </b>
<blockquote> 
Node.js is a JavaScript-based framework for writing servers and other network programs. Over the last few years it has rapidly been gaining popularity as a web-development platform. In this talk, I'll give an overview of Node.js and talk about some of my (good and bad) experiences with JavaScript. Along the way I'll explain Node's scalability claims, show a few examples of node.js in action and (hopefully) dispel some of the myths and misunderstandings surrounding the JavaScript language.
