<b>Distribution Shootout</b> 
</br>
<i>A discussion about some of the different Linux distributions</i>
<br><a href="http://goozbach.com/team.html">Derek Carter (aka goozbach)</a></br>
</br>
We'll discuss the main families of Linux distros; benefits and downsides
of each; and help you decide which is best for your needs.
This presentation is mostly focused to new users of Linux, however
veteran users will most likely find some little tip or trick.

<b>Raspberry Pi</b> 
</br>
<i>With Cheap Power Comes Great Possibilities</i>
<br>David Millians</br>
</br>
The Raspberry Pi is a small and inexpensive computer the size of a deck 
of cards. It is the perfect device to learn and test Linux on, because 
changing distros can be done as simply as swapping flash cards. Learn 
some of the basic points of using a Pi, and see what it can do!
