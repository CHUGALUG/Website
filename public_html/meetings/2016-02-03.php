Recently, Free IT Athens (Frita) had some problems with its website and related infrastructures. I spent some time figuring out what was there, what was working, what wasn't, etc. This presentation is mostly a report to the folks at Frita about what I found. But, in the course of the presentation, I will be explaining the core aspects of a large number of modern websites. If you are interested in learning more about Frita, or if you would like a practical, under-the-hood look at websites and web-services, this is a good meeting for you.
