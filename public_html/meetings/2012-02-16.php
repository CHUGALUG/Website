<b>Debugging Memory Leaks In Ruby </b>
<blockquote> 
In this talk, I'll give an overview of what a memory leak is, how they
occur in general and specifically in ruby, and a cursory review of
tools used to diagnose them in ruby.  We'll delve in further with one
specific tool (yet to be determined) and walk through a case study.
