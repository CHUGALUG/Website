<b>LTSP (Linux Terminal Server Project)</b>
<blockquote> 
Ever wondered what you can do with that old computer that still works, 
but is a little slow, especially now that you have a new one? You could 
make it a terminal of the new one. LTSP is used most often in educational 
environments because it is cost effective and gives the teacher easy control 
over a classroom full of computers. The features are advanced and versatile, 
able to be configured for the locked-down environment of a public kiosk as well 
as the freedom needed in a research environment. Come see what all it can do!
