<p>Jonathan Wallace gave a great presentation on
<a href="http://maglev.github.com/">MagLev</a> and general issues with determining the trustworthiness
of open source software.

<p>

<b> Using MagLev to evaluate the Trustiness of Github Open Source projects </b> 
<br> 
<blockquote> 
This talk is an excuse for me to implement an automated metric for evaluating the responsiveness and quality of open source projects on Github with MagLev, a Ruby implementation with many cool features.  We'll review the interesting features of MagLev, what makes a good open source software maintainer, and how to evaluate them.
