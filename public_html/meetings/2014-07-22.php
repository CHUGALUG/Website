<h2>Introducing Pattern Matching and Regular Expresions and Advanced Regex Patterns and Data Transformation</h2>
<p>Date: Jul. 22, 2014</p>

<p>
James Gibson gave great presentations on pattern matching and regular expressions,
taking us from the basics through advanced ways to manipulate data.
</p>
<p>
Here are the details:
</p>
<u>Introductory topic:</u>
<br></br>
<b>Introducing Pattern Matching and Regular Expresions </b> 
<br>James Gibson</br>
</br>
This will be an introduction to pattern matching, focusing on Regular Expressions. I'll cover why, and where, you might need to match patterns; briefly introduce wildcard matching; and then introduce regular expressions, illustrating ways that they can be more useful than a straight wildcard match. Tools will likely be limited to grep, find, and will introduce sed. 
<br></br>
<u>Advanced topic:</u>
<br></br>
<b>Advanced Regex Patterns and Data Transformation</b> 
<br>James Gibson</br>
</br>
This will cover more esoteric regular expression syntax including grouping, look ahead/behind, word boundaries and backreferences. I will start off using grep and sed to illustrate, and will transition to using awk and perl one liners (my intention is to have the same examples in both languages).
