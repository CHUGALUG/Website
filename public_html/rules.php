<h3>Membership</h3>
<p>
  CHUGALUG has no offical membership.  Ours is a loose association
of people who dig Linux.  We like to get together and talk about Linux,
help each other with Linux problems or projects, and socialize with
other people who dig Linux.<p>
  So you see it isn't really something you become a member of- it's more
something you attend when you feel like it.<p>


<h3>Do we have rules?</h3>
    CHUGALUG has never had any formal rules and most of us agree that we
don't need any.<p>

    The thinking is that we would rather spend our time enjoying Linux
    and each other's company than fussing with a lot of rules, administrative
    overhead and politics.
