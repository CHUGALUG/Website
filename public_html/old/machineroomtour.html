<h1>Machine Room Tour</h1>

<pre>

UCNS is willing to give us a tour of their machine room, but the size
is limited to 15 people.  They've asked that we schedule for a morning
or early afternoon.  One person expressed a desire to have the tour
on a Tuesday or Thursday.  I'd like to shoot for Jan. 16th at 11:00am.
I'll listen to what you guys want to do.  I'll update this page once
the tour is confirmed.at


People who responded and followed direction and who have a confirmed
spot on the waiting list.  Congratulations!

1  Charles Nicolosi (confirmed)
2  Harvey Kirkpatrick (confirmed)
3  Piotr Misztal (confirmed)
4  Mike Basinger
