It's time once again boys and girls for CHUGALUG.&nbsp; The ClassicHackers
UGA Linux Users Group meets this Thursday at 7:00 downstairs at The Hard
Drive Cafe on N. Lumpkin.</FONT><FONT FACE=""></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The plan is to have our first "install party" where people who are just
getting started with Linux (or want to) can bring their machines in and
get help with a basic install.&nbsp; I'm thinking we can probably</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="">handle 3 or 4 machines.&nbsp; If you would like to bring
your box in, please send me e-mail so I know how many people to prepare
for.&nbsp; If you're bringing in anything other than an Intel box, such
as an Alpha,</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="">Sparc, or Mac, please let me know ahead of time.&nbsp;
This should be a great meeting for folks who want to learn more about Linux
but don't know where to start.&nbsp; Even those of you who have installed
Linux a few</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="">times may learn something from looking over somebody
else's shoulder- I usually do. :)</FONT><FONT FACE=""></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I also plan to have my box setup to everybody can see QuakeII and BZFlag(beta)
running under Linux.&nbsp; I still need to get permission to show BZFlag,
but I don't think that will be a problem. Of course, we will be talking
about all things Linux as usual. :)</FONT><FONT FACE=""></FONT>

If you have any questions about CHUGALUG or the meeting on Thursday, feel
free to ask.</FONT></TD>
