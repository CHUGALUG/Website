Subject:      Welcome (once again)
 
Hey,
 
See this?  It means you're on the new ABBA list!  Welcome.
Your hosts here are:
Mike Weaver <weaver@arches.uga.edu>
nathan hruby <nhruby@arches.uga.edu>

ABBA stands for "Athens BroadBand Access" and is the successor of the aah
"Athens@Home" list (aah@giffords.net, then aah@dstatement.com).

You're currently subscribed to this list because you were a subscriber of
the aah@dstatement.com list.  That list will cease to operate shortly.
This is a ListServ based list hosted by the University Of Georgia.  It has
web accessible archives and management capabilities, check out
http://www.listserv.uga.edu/ for details and instructions.  Please note
that most of the old aah list options you may have set (INCLUDING DIGEST
MODE) have been irradicated.  Please take a moment to look over your
subscription options and set them as you see fit.

You can see a general overview of instructions for listserv at:
http://www.listserv.uga.edu/ownerfaq/subnotes2.html

Complete (and lengthy :) documentation is availible at:
http://www.listserv.uga.edu/docs.html

This list is meant as a meeting place for discussing various network broad
band technologies, such as cable modems, xDSL, Frame Relay, Freenets banks
of channel bonded 9600 baud modems, etc.. that are available in the
Athens, Georgia area. Talking tech, problem solving, Terms of Service
issues / questions and general "Look What I Can Do" discussions are
encouraged.  We are OS agnostic.

This list is open to the public, not just university members, and you are
encouraged to spread the news about this list to anyone who you think
would be interested.

If you are (or represent) a BroadBand Service Provider, you are espically
welcomed to the list, as we would encourage local providers to participate
in the discussions.  We know that you can't always speak for your company,
and that (at least in this forum) you're here as a innocent bystander who
may (or may not) just happen to know a bit more about a particular service
than most other folks :)

Welcome and enjoy.
