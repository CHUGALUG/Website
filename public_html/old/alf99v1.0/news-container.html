<b>1/17/1999</b>  I did some website updates now that ALF99v1.0 is history.
Besure to leave some comments!<p>
I need to update the listservs with the data we collected at ALF registration.
Later...<p>


<b>1/17/1999</b>  Ok, this needs to be said since we helped SO many
  people get Linux installed yesterday...
  <p>
  Directly e-mailing people should NOT be your first choice when you run
  into something you don't know how to do.<p>
  First read the man pages and look for documentation in the Linux
  Documentation Project (LDP).  If you can't figure something out 
  by yourself in the documentation you find on the net, then you might
  post a well thought out request for help to a newsgroup.<p>
  If you would like to post your question to a forum where local Linux
  users frequent, go to the CHUGALUG webpage and click the
  communications link.  Generally, Linux veterans are happy to help
  you provided you are courteous AND you've read the available
  documentation and made a good faith effort to get it fixed yourself.<p>

  <b>1/17/1999</b> Well, nobody asked about the prizes from EST- the
BRU 2000 and the QuickStart Data Rescue.  Unfortunately, the prizes
haven't arrived- that's why we didn't give 'em away at ALF.<p>
<hr>
<b>1/17/1999</b>Whew... got some much needed sleep and managed to set
my computer back up at home.  The work computers are for later
today..<p> Keep watching the ALF/CHUGALUG pages over the next few
days.  I plan to put up a feedback area where you can post comments
about ALF99v1.0.<p>
I also plan to put of photos from the show, possibly screen grabs from the webcam, and maybe a few surprise. :)<p>
Thanks to <b>everybody</b> who made ALF such huge success!

<hr>
<b>1/16/1999 - 7pm ish</b>
Wow! ALF was wildly sucessful!  We're heading to T-Stand downtown now..
I'll post more later...
<hr>
<b>1/16/1999 - 8:30am</b> Today's the big
day!  We spent last night setting up the network, tables, the sound
system and just generally goofing off.  Be sure to have Kevin show you his talking penguin mug.<p>
Finished writing the registration/nametag system last night too.  Looks like it going to do nicely in it's first beta test. hehe.<p>
I'm about to turn off my machine and pack it up for the event.  If you need
to get in touch with me, go to my webpage and use the <a href="http://www.coe.uga.edu/~golliher/pageme.html">pager form</a>.  It sends alphanumerice messages straight to me.  Neat-o.<p>

<b>1/15/1999</b> Well it's T minus 1 day and things are really shaping
  up.  We've got 20 people (yes 20!) people bringing their computers
  in to install Linux.  Wow!<p>
<hr>

<b>1/14/1999</b> Updated the where & where page a little bit.. check
it out if you don't know where to go. :)

<hr>
<b>1/14/1999</b> I put up new links tonight-
one to recognize the great vendor support ALF has recieved and one to
list all the <b>PRIZES</b> we will be giving away on Saturday. :)
<p>

Most of the people who have signed up have been paired with volunteers,
but we're still actively seeking more Linux helpers.  I think ALF got
announced at tonight's ALE meeting in Atlanta so maybe we'll get a
couple of volunteers from that.
<hr>

<b>1/14/1999</b> I've paired up volunteers with installees all except
  for a couple because we still need more volunteers.  Keep watching
  the webpage, we will be posting several more things including
  directions and a list of prizes. Everything is right on track and
  I'm looking forward to seeing you all on Saturday!
  <hr>

  <b>1/12/1999</b>I put up a few cheesy counters because I'm about to
  send an article to Slashdot, and I'm curious to see how many hits we
  take from it.<p>
  I guess I'm being optimistic that my article will get posted. :)
  <hr>

  
  <b>1/12/1999</b> I just discovered that PowerQuest, makers of PartitionMagic,
  have a User Group Relations department.  I registered us, but there
  may not be time before Saturday for us to get on their program.  They will
  let us order PM4 for $30 instead of the regular $69.95 and I'm
  thinking of placing and order if there is interest.<p>
  I'm also hoping that they will donate a Professional License to our
  user group even if it's only for Saturday.  I left voice mail for
  Gene Barlow who is in charge or URG.  Keep your fingers crossed!
  <hr>

  <b>1/11/1999</b> We're starting to get quite a crowd signed up for ALF.
  Some of the organizers are meeting Tuesday evening to have a
  planning session.  We will probably pair people up with volunteers
  and start getting in touch with the folks who have signed up as
  both volunteers and installees.<p>
  Apologies to those of you who've signed up, but haven't heard back
  from us yet.  
<hr>


  <b>1/8/1999</b>  The sign-ups are starting to come in now that the form
  is on-line and we're getting vounteers too!  I put Greg's new
  version of the Flyer up on... grab it- it has nifty tears offs.<p>

  Nobody's posted flyers at Best Buy yet... maybe somebody wants to go do
  that for us?  Maybe if you talked nice enough the manager might even
  let you tape flyers the the RedHat boxes. :)
  
<hr>

  <b>1/7/1999</b>  I see on the flyers page that some of you have been busy.  Great!
  Post more flyers!  The sign-up form is on-line.  I kept putting it
  off because I was going to make it this massively comprehenive
  questionaire about the type of hardware coming in.  Blah.  I like
  my new idea better. *smile*<p>
  Greg is getting us all fired up about the Trivia Quiz show.  Did I
  mention prizes?  Well there, now I have. :)  I think I'll go work on
  some questions now...
    
  
  <hr>
<b>1/6/1998</b>  Keith posted an ALF announcement to the newsgroups and after
  getting a couple of volunteers signed-up from that I relized I
  needed to ask for e-mail addresses on the volunteer form.  That is
  fixed now. :)  If John Harte is reading this, please send me you'r
  e-mail address and THANKS for volunteering!
  <hr>


  <b>1/3/1998</b> Greg has a new version of the Flyer.  He's removed the "Psst"
  text and has added tear-offs with the URL and date.  I'll get it on
  the Flyers page this evening!
<hr>

  <b>1/3/998</b> The ALF page is up!  It's still a little rough, but time is
running short.  It's time to get the word out!<br> <p> Be sure to
check out the flyers, banner and volunteer sections!  <p>
