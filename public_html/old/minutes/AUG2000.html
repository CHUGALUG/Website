CHUGALUG Meeting Minutes - Thursday, Aug 31 2000.
=================================================


- Presentation: Darrell Golliher / TiVo Hacking

  Darrell gave a splendid, live presentation of the TiVo television
  appliance and how it works, as well as how to mess around with its
  dark internals to gain more functionality and performance, and
  because it's just .. fun.

  For those un-enlightened, the TiVo is a television appliance that
  runs on embedded PowerPC Linux and allows a great degree of control
  over your television viewing experience, including storage of TV
  programs, automatic recording, and the ability to traverse the
  length of the current show back and forth (i.e. if you missed a portion
  of it).   For more information, see http://www.tivo.com, or
  e-mail Darrell at <golliher@coe.uga.edu> ...

- ALF 3.0?

  As of this time, the theoretical date for Athens Linux Fest 3.0
  has been scheduled for February 3rd, 2001.  This was the conclusion
  reached in the light of the circumstances (i.e. inability to hold
  ALF this fall).  The CHUGALUG ALF 3.0 planning committee will hold
  its meeting on Wednesday, September 6th, 2000 at 6:00 PM at the
  residence of J.B. Jordin.  Anyone and everyone interested is invited
  to attend, and acquaintance with J.B. is unnecessary to attend the
  planning meeting.  Anyone else interested in helping with ALF 3.0
  should make this intention known.

- Hackday

  In observation of cravings for another Hackday sometime soon, the issue
  of housing for the event has come up.  CHUGALUG would like to hold
  another Hackday sometime in September or October this year, but is
  pressed for space.  The usual room in Sanford Hall is booked by the
  business school to the brim, and few other rooms on campus are available
  that would provide sufficient power and networking capability to
  service the event (~20 Linux geeks, 2-3 computers per geek assumed).

  If you know of any on-campus location suitable to hold a Hackday that
  may be available, please let CHUGALUG know.  We are looking into other
  options, but they are not looking especially optimistic.

- Dr. Mike Basinger will be taking over as UGALINUX manager.

  Yep.  Just that.  Now you e-mail <dbasinge@CVIOG.UGA.EDU> if you want
  to [un]subscribe from UGALINUX.  You will, anyway.

- T-Shirt designs needed.

  Right, we need t-shirt designs for the ALF 3.0 t-shirt.  Nothing
  immediate, but, we'd like them soon, since we raise money for supporting
  ALF largely through the sale of t-shirts.
