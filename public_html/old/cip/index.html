  Our second install party was a success! Nelson Hilton from the UGA
English department brought his machine and went home with a successful
installation of RedHat Linux 5.0!  Here's what he had to say after the 
install party.<p>
<i><font size="-1">
Thanks to all involved for the great install party! can't tell you how
much I appreciate your help in getting me up and running-- xfree at last!
Couldn't have happened without your help--so I am infinitely obliged and
will strive to carry on and be worthy of your generous example.
Cheers,
Nelson

We look forward to seeing Nelson at the CHUGALUG meetings to talk about his 
new system. :)<p>
Although Carla didn't sucessfully get Linux installed (she had a bad hard drive),
she definately wins the prize for most <a href="transport.html">creative computer transport device</a>.
Check out the bumper sticker. :)<p>
