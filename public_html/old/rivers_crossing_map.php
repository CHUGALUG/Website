<h3>Meeting Map</h3>

Meetings are held at the UGA Educational Technology Center at Rivers Crossing.  The address is 850 College Station Road.     We meet in the building at the bottom that says 'Technology Training Center' on the door.<br /><br />

<b>Google shows the marker closer to Research drive than it actually is!</b>  The building is on the south side of the road about a quarter mile west of Research Drive<br /><br />
