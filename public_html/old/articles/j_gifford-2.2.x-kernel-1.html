I know I mentioned to some of you that I would let you know a basic
"roadmap" of how to get from stock RH5.2 to RH5.2+2.2.x kernel.
Well, there's no easy "just do this and things will be great" method
that I'm aware of yet.

Almost every component of the kernel has changed in some way.  Much
of it in rather drastic ways.  Here's just a short list of things
that bit me (primarily because I didn't read *ALL* the documentation
in /usr/src/linux/Documentation):

When bringing up an interface, the kernel now automatically adds
a route for that network through that interface.  If your scripts
do this as a seperate step (RH5.2 does) then you need to fix them.

SMP:

   Kernel 2.2.x has the wonderful ability to use the advanced PIC
   chips (That's Programmable Interrupt Controller).  In the bad
   days when Bill said "Let there be 640K", PC's only had 8 IRQ's,
   numbered 0 to 7.  When IBM designed the AT (or maybe it was in
   the XT, I forget), they added a second PIC.  The way a PIC works
   is that IRQ lines on the bus are tied to one of the 8 inputs on
   the PIC chip, and the output of the PIC chip is tied to the 1
   IRQ line on the CPU.  With 2 PIC chips, we can have 15 total
   IRQ's (yes, 15, not 16).  Basically, the second PIC chip is
   "cascaded" by attaching it's output to the IRQ2 pin on the first
   PIC.  Since there was direct access to IRQ 2 on the ISA bus in
   the original design, and IRQ 2 was stolen for the cascade, IBM
   tied IRQ 9 to the same line on the ISA bus that had been IRQ 2.
   This is why you often see it referred to as IRQ 9/2.  Well, on
   SMP based systems, Intel took things a step further.  They
   designed into the MP specs a chip called the IO-APIC.  This is
   one sweet chip.  It allows, among other things, remapping of
   IRQ's.  Combine this with the fact that the PCI bus allows shared
   IRQ's, and you end up with a really nice combination, that works
   damned fast.  I think I now have something like 21 IRQ's.  By
   default, this chip runs in "emulate two PIC chips" mode (similar
   to x86 processors initializing at 8086 compatibility mode, aka
   "real" mode).  "How did this bite you?" I hear you ask.  Well...
   in the old kernel, there was PCI IRQ sharing.  In the new kernel,
   there isn't.  I had to move one of my network cards to a different
   PCI slot so it got a different IRQ assigned.  I also had to
   diddle in the CMOS setup to set that flag that says "Reset ESCD
   information" or something like that, to force the BIOS to reassign
   PCI IRQ's.  From my /proc/interrupts:



              CPU0       CPU1
     0:   28625287   28935480    IO-APIC-edge  timer

   NMI:          0
   ERR:          0


SMC EtherPower and EtherPower II:

   There are still some bugs with these in an SMP based system.
   Under Kernel 2.0.36, the EtherPower (using the Tulip driver)
   was rock solid, and the EtherPower II (using the epic100 driver)
   was in Beta (although once I got a good ethernet cable in use,
   it was stable).  Under the new kernel, it appeared to be the
   other way around.  In my system, I have both cards installed.
   Prior to upgrade, the 10MB card was on the public net (routed
   to the rest of the world), and the 100MB card was on the private
   net (not routed at all).  Since the EtherPower II now *MUST* be
   the first of the two initialized, it ends up being eth0, and so
   now is my public net interface.  The determination of this
   problem took some number of hours of investigation.  Basically,
   if the epic100 driver initialize *after* either the Tulip or
   de4x5 driver, it renders both inoperable.  If using modules,
   simply rmmod of both and insmod in correct order makes things
   work, so I think it is kernel structures getting stepped on by
   the epic100 driver.  I have not (yet) reported this bug to the
   kernel developers.

MTRR:

   From /usr/src/linux/Documentation/mtrr.txt:
   >  On Intel Pentium Pro/Pentium II systems the Memory Type Range
   >  Registers (MTRRs) may be used to control processor access to memory
   >  ranges. This is most useful when you have a video (VGA) card on a
   >  PCI or AGP bus. Enabling write-combining allows bus write transfers
   >  to be combined into a larger transfer before bursting over the
   >  PCI/AGP bus. This can increase performance of image write operations
   >  2.5 times or more.

   This is really sweet.  I *highly* recommend you read this if
   you have a Pentium Pro or Pentium II system.  This bit me because
   I enabled the feature in the kernel, and *didn't* configure it,
   so my X was dog ass slow, especially doing window moving (it
   reminded me of the days I ran X on a 386/33 with 8M of RAM).
   I properly configured this, and now my X is much faster than it
   ever was before.  From my /proc/mtrr:

   reg00: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size= 128MB: write-back, count=1
   reg01: base=0xf8000000 (3968MB), size=   4MB: write-combining, count=1

KMOD:

   You no longer need kerneld, they replaced that with a more
   generic method for the kernel to call back to userspace programs.
   Read /usr/src/linux/Documentation/Changes.

WindowMaker:

   I broke the major rule of upgrades: "Never change more than one
   variable at a time".  I upgraded my WindowMaker to 0.51.0 (from
   0.20something) at the same time as I did my kernel upgrade.  I
   blamed much of the slowdown in X on my kernel, when a good amount
   of the blame can fall on WindowMaker.  However, the features
   added far outweigh the slight slowing of certain things from
   this upgrade.  I thing I'll also blame my video card.  *grin*

NFS:

   As I said at the last CHUGALUG meeting, NFS has changed
   significantly.  For one thing, the kernel now knows things about
   SUN RPC's.  There's proper locking, and I *think* even support
   for NFS over TCP client *and* server.  In any case, I use my
   Linux machine as an NFS client to a Solaris 2.5.1 server.  I
   didn't tweak any of my usual settings
   (nosuid,bg,intr,rsize=8192,wsize=8192), and things appear to be
   *somewhat* faster.  Reads are an order of magnitude faster than
   writes.  I'm not sure why writes are so slow, but I'll look into
   it at some point.  As an example,

   [1230] jim@pi:/var/tmp $ ls -l testfile
   -rw-r--r--   1 jim      sysadmin  8318229 Feb  8 11:33 testfile
   [1231] jim@pi:/var/tmp $ time mv testfile /home/jim/testfile
   0.01user 1.27system 0:49.64elapsed 2%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
   0inputs+0outputs (2112major+11minor)pagefaults 0swaps
   [1232] jim@pi:/var/tmp $ time mv /home/jim/testfile testfile
   0.01user 0.57system 0:00.77elapsed 74%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
   0inputs+0outputs (81major+11minor)pagefaults 0swaps
   [1233] jim@pi:/var/tmp $ time mv testfile /home/jim/testfile
   0.01user 1.07system 0:50.87elapsed 2%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
   0inputs+0outputs (2112major+11minor)pagefaults 0swaps
   [1234] jim@pi:/var/tmp $ time mv /home/jim/testfile testfile
   0.01user 0.58system 0:00.72elapsed 80%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
   0inputs+0outputs (81major+11minor)pagefaults 0swaps

   As you can see, ~50 seconds to write ~8M, and ~1 second to read
   ~8M.  I personally don't think this is reasonable behavior, and
   will eventually get around to finding out why it does this.
   *shrug*  YMMV.

SCSI:

   Under 2.0.36, I could have a process streaming a 256Kbps .mp3
   file to an icecast server (running on the same host), at the
   same time that I had a process reading CDDA and 2 bladeenc
   processes doing mp3 encoding (one at 256Kbps and the other at
   128Kbps.  Obviously, this would keep my load avg rather high.
   Under the 2.2.x kernel, The CDDA process and the Shout process
   seem to want to run at a Real Time priority, and end up contending
   for the SCSI bus.  On my AHA-2940, this results in frequent SCSI
   transfer timeouts and SCSI bus resets.  The system continues
   running, but all disk IO "freezes" during the SCSI bus reset.
   My solution: run shout on another host.  The craziest part of
   this is that shout was reading the .mp3 files via NFS.  Go
   figure.


I'm sure that as time goes on, these and other things will settle
out into a wonderfully stable system, and I really love the snappiness
of my new kernel.

For those of you considering taking the plunge, here's my advice:

Read *ALL* the files (and all of the Changes file) in
/usr/src/linux/Documentation.  Visit http://www.linuxhq.com, and
under the "New Stable Release" section, grab the 2.2.1 kernel (don't
even *try* the 2.2.0 kernel), and read through the "Upgrading"
links in that section.  As with anything, just jumping in with both
feet without being adequately prepared is suicidal.  Take the time
to learn about it *before* it breaks something that you missed.

Hasta,
jim
