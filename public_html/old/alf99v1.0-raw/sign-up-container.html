<!--<b>  The sign-up form is here!  Let us know that you are coming
  and what you are bringing.  It will help us have a much more
  pleasant and successful time helping you install Linux.<p>
</b>
  For past install parties, we've asked a ton of very specific
  questions.  We're going to try a different approach.  Tell
  us as much as you can about your computer, especially about
  and peripherals and we'll pair you up with an install volunteer.
  Your install helper will ask  you more questions if they need to.
