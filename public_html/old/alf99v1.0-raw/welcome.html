Note:  The tense is wrong now that ALF is history, but this should still give you an idea of what it was all about.

<center><b>Welcome!</b></center><p>

The Athens Linux Fest (ALF) is a Linux install party plus a few
extras.  Our user group (CHUGALUG) is interested in helping people get
started with Linux and so we are hosting this, our third, install party.
<p>

What is an install party anyway?  It's an opportunity for people to
bring in their computers and get help installing it from experienced
Linux users.  It's also an opportunity for people who have just
installed Linux to bring it in to get help with some system tweaking.
<p>

So what are the <i>extras</i> at ALF?  We're not just helping to
install Linux.  We are also going to be giving a technology
demonstration of a sort.  Local Linux users will be bringing in their
own computers to demonstrate some of the wonderful programs available
for Linux.  We are also working on a couple of other ideas to have some fun.
<p>

Not enough extras for you?  How about free stuff!  We are very
happy that several Linux vendors have sent of packages of goodies to
give away as prizes.
<p>

Interested?  Great!  If you would like to bring in your computer, it
would help us tremendously if you would sign-up in advance so we know
we have enough volunteers to help everybody.
