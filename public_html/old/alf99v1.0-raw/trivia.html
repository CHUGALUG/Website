Hi,

  We're collecting questions for a Linux Triva game for this
  Saturdays ALF event.  Thanks SO much for helping by submitting
  questions.<p>

  Below is Greg's e-mail to me explaning what he needs to pull off the
  quiz show.<p>
<hr width=40%>

There needs to be two types of questions: toss ups and bonus questions.
<p>
* Toss ups need to be one answer questions such as (taking from Rick's
  questions):  
<br>
What is the code name of any given current development version of RedHat?
=RawHide
<p>

* Bonus questions should be multi-part MIME encoded....err, make that
  multi-part questions in one of the following forms:
<br>
For X points each, correctly define the following acronyms:
  <ol>
    <li>WYSIWYG
    <li>SMTP
    <li>CGI
    <li>URL
  </ol>
<br>
OR
For X points each, name any four major Linux distributions.
<br>
You get the idea.  They can be varying degrees of difficultly so don't
try to make everything easy or hard.
<p>


So, let's start with:<br>
Linux and linux community questions (Rick)<br>
Unix and general networking questions (Darrell)<br>
Internet and web questions (Keith)<br>
General computing, miscellaneous questions (Greg)<br>
<p>
Don't be constrained with these categories.  If you think of a question,
write it down whether it's in your category or not.  We'll swap these
around in a few days.
