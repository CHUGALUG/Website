I thought ALF was great! :-) I was amazed at the
number of folks we had turn out for the event!
Very impressive!  Good job on the web pages, Darrell!

ALF rocked! I can't believe I drank all that Coke.
:-)  Maybe next time we should use a switch and some local servers.
Everyone seemed happy, even Happy. Thanks to everyone,
especially Keith and Darrell, for making ALF 1.0 a
success!!!

:-)

ALF ruled! I had not been to any Chugalug events

interested in Linux. Congrats to the organizers..

Alf was a huge success.  Thanks for making my first CHUGALUG experince a good one. I was amazed at the things Linux can be made to do.  I'm getting a new HD now for Red Hat 5.2 b/c of ALF.  Looking forward to the next CHUGALUG event.

ALF, isn't that a nasty little alien with a big nose that eats all the time? The 'Fest' was great. Many thanks to all the guys who put up with my netcard problem. Oh, next time, hide the projector. Kevin rox ma fro!

Yegods. I mean, I thought there were gonna be like ten of us showing up, sitting around, and talking about the good ole' days when men were real men, women were real women, and when someone asked what OS you used you'd answer either "BSD" or "SysV". 

Seriously tho, I must say it was a happenin' happenin' thing. Thanks to Mr. Emcee, Greg "Cool Unix Guy" Whitlock for an awesomely fun addition to the afternoon, and to all of those who came and saw without necessarily knowing why they were there. You're beautiful, babe. never change. ::wink wink::

Thanks for the install help at ALF, y'all!  It was
nice to finally get Linux up & running :).  Of
course, *now*, at home, it's booting 10 times as 
slowly and not letting me set up my printer, but
hey! -- I'm a Linux user now! :):):)
See y'all next Thursday---
