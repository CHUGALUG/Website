  CHUGALUG has no offical membership.  Ours is a loose association
of people who dig Linux.  We like to get together and talk about Linux,
help each other with Linux problems or projects, and socialize with 
other people who dig Linux.<p>
  So you see it isn't really something you become a member of- it's more 
something you attend when you feel like it.<p>
