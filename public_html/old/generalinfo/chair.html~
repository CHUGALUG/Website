<b>Chairman</b><p>
    The group currently has no leader.
    <a href="http://www.coe.uga.edu/~golliher">Darrell Golliher</a>,
    <a
    href="mailto:darrell+chugalug@golliher.net">darrell@golliher.net</a> last led the group.<p>
As a group with no rules, there are no rules for who can be
the groups president,chair, or whaterever you want to call it.
<p>
It could be said that Darrell usurped the leadership role.  Others might
say he rivived the group.  Either way it's a certaintly he wasn't
elected- he just kinda took over with the blessing of the previous
chair.<p>
    
Are you the next CHUGALUG chairman?
