<b>Newsgroup: </b>
<DL>
<DT>uga.tech.linux
<DD>The original place for CHUGALUGers to talk about Linux, post and answer questions, etc.  This group is not propagated outside of the University of Georgia, but we do have a news2mail gateway.  See below.
</DL>
<b>Mailing lists: </b><br>
<DL>
<DT>ugalinux@listserv.uga.edu 
<DD>Serves as an e-mail bi-directional gateway to uga.tech.linux for people who either can't
get the uga.* newsgroups or who prefer to particpate via e-mail instead of 
through news.  In order to keep the mailing list reserved for <i>local</i> Linux users, 
subscription is moderated.  Send e-mail to <a
    href="mailto://ugalinux-request@listserv.uga.edu">ugalinux-request@listserv.uga.edu</a> and ask to be put on the list.  <a href="mailto://darrell@golliher.net">Darrell Golliher</a> is taking care of the UGALINUX list and he'll help you get your subscription setup.
<DT>chugalug@listserv.uga.edu
<DD>This list is for CHUGALUG announcements.  It is for people who want to get meeting announcements, but do not choose to participate in uga.tech.linux or ugalinux@listserv.uga.edu.  Announcements also get posted to those places.
To subscribe send "subscribe chugalug Full Name" in the text
of a message to listserv@listserv.uga.edu.

    <b>IRC Channel</b><br>
(now defunct, but maybe if someone cares we will start it back up,
-darrell 8/12/2001)
      <dl>
	<dt>#chugalug on slashnet
	<dd>This is a new experiment for CHUGALUG.  A place to hang
	    out on-line with members in real time.  For now we simply
	    create a channel "#chugalug" on slashnet.  Maybe later we
	    will have a bot to hold our channel or maybe we'll even
	    setup our own IRC server.  Who knows.<p>
	    To connect, fire up your favorite IRC client (like XChat)
	    and connect to server us.slashnet.org.  Once there type
	    /join #chugalug. <p>
	    Note, this is *not* the best way to reach CHUGALUG
	    members.  This is just an experiment.  Use the methods
	    below for more reliable communication.
