	<dt>#chugalug on slashnet
	<dd>This is a new experiment for CHUGALUG.  A place to hang
	    out on-line with members in real time.  For now we simply
	    create a channel "#chugalug" on slashnet.  Maybe later we
	    will have a bot to hold our channel or maybe we'll even
	    setup our own IRC server.  Who knows.<p>
	    To connect, fire up your favorite IRC client (like XChat)
	    and connect to server us.slashnet.org.  Once there type
	    /join #chugalug. <p>
	    Note, this is *not* the best way to reach CHUGALUG
	    members.  This is just an experiment.  Use the methods
	    below for more reliable communication.
