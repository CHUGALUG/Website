<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Configuring a Linux workstation for @home</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 DHCP</A>
</H2>

<P>@home uses DHCP for network configuration.  Put very simply, your
computer sends out a network broadcast message asking for its
network configuration.  The folks who run the @home network have
a DHCP server that listens for requests and responds with an IP address
and other configuration information such as gateway, netmask and
nameservers that your machine will use as its configuration.
<P>It is not absolutely necessary to configure your Linux box to use
DHCP.  In practice @home addresses are statically assigned according to your
"CI" number.  However, @home does not guarantee you a static assignment
and reserves the right to change your address at anytime.
<P>I recommend that you do use DHCP and I'll tell you how to
configure that in the next section.
<P>
<H3>dhcpcd software</H3>

<P>@home requires that you broadcast your "CI" number as your hostname in
order to get an answer from their DHCP server(s).  Newer versions of
the DHCP client for Linux can send this information.  Make sure
you have an up to date version of dhcpcd.  I'm using the RPM package
dhcpcd-1.3.16-0.i386.rpm that's part of the updates RedHat software
has published to upgrade RedHat 5.2 to work with the 2.2 series
kernels.  Localally, you can get a copy from linuxserv.uga.edu in the
directory /pub/unix/linux/redhat/updates/5.2.
<P>
<H3>configuring dhcpcd</H3>

<P>On a RedHat system use the network control-panel to setup a ethernet
interface.  You want to set the "Interface contiguration protocol" to
DHCP.
<P>Next edit /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifup.  Find the line that
contains the dhcpcd command and insert a -h switch and your CI number
that @home assigned you.  By default the dhcpcd program will not
broadcast your hostname and so @home will not answer your request.
The -h switch tells dhcpcd to send your CI number in its request.
<P>Here's what that line looks like in my ifup file.
<P>/sbin/dhcpcd -h ciXXXXXX  -c /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifdhcpc-done ${DEVICE}
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Proxy servers</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>@home provides proxy servers that you may use if you want to.  You
should see better performance by using the @home proxies, but you also
reveal to them which sites you vist.  I choose not to use the proxies
and so haven't looked into setting them up under Linux.  If you would
like to add information to this section, please let me know.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Security </A>
</H2>

<P>You should consider the @home network and the Internet at large to be
a hostile environment. Take precautions to protect yourself.  At a
minimum, disable any network services you aren't actually using and
install and configure TCP wrappers.
<P>
