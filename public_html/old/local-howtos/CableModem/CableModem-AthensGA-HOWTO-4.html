<P>These are mostly snippets culled from the UGALINUX and AAH mailing
lists.

<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Jim Gifford reported the following on the cable modems:</A>
</H2>

<P>I've had this cable modem 2 weeks now.  I discovered the first day
I had it that it had 2 IP addresses and MAC addresses of it's own.
They are unassigned network addresses.  The HFC (Hybrid Fiber
Copper) side has a 10.x.x.x address, and the Ethernet side has
192.168.100.1.  Tonight, I thought it'd be cool to see if it answered
to telnet.  Nope.  Then I checked port 80.  Y'all might be
surprised/interested in what you can see about your cable modem
this way.  Have fun.  I haven't yet done a portscan of mine, but
it's interesting that this is here...  I suspect that it's got SNMP
as well.  http://192.168.100.1/

<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Mark Hazen reported on traffic filtered by @home:</A>
</H2>

<P>Surprise, surprise,... @home is filtering your inbound and outbound
traffic. I got a response from the tech manager for this region today,
regarding Micro$oft networking (i.e. SMB).... that's one of the 'many'
services they filter out due to it's... how did he phrase it...
'potential security problems and other issues'. I'm trying to get a list
of exactly everything they filter.
<P>Mark later recived email from an @home rep about this.  Here's the
relavant excerpt:
<P>Due to various Microsoft networking holes, we have blocked NetBios
ports across our backbone. (137-139)
Otherwise, users were able to access other user's harddrives and
other networked resources, causing general havok, etc.
<P>Mark has been asked by Intermedia our local cable company to:
<P>"formulate a reponse to @home, to the effect of `Here's what we need
to do, and why you should let us do it'"
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 Jim again, this time on cable modems and MAC addresses:</A>
</H2>

<P>One thing I learned is that the cable
modem learns your MAC address, so changing them around willy-nilly
isn't a good idea.  Also, the cable modems are limited to only 4
MAC addresses they can keep up with.
<P>My recommendation is to actually power off the cable modem when
you change your NIC.
<H2><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4 Cable modems and power disconnects, reported by Darrell Golliher</A>
</H2>

<P>One of the @home tech's told me that the cable modems take longer to
"sync" if they have been unplugged or have completely lost power.  If
you merely turn them off with the power switch, the modem remembers
what frequency its signal is supposed to be on.  I guess the point is
that there is a difference between pulling the plug and flipping the
switch on these modems.
