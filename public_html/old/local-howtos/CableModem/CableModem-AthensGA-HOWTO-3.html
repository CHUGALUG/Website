</H2>

<P>For now, I'm just going to paste in a copy of an e-mail I sent to the
UGALINUX list.  I'll probably re-write this section later, or at
least re-edit it.
<P>
<P>As for multiple computer on one cable modem, there are several ways to go.
<P>1) Buy a 1 hub, plus 1 network card for each machine you wish to connect.
@home gives you one card so that's one less you have to buy.  You then
have to pay $5 extra per month to @home for additional IPs.
<P>2) Same equipment as above, but don't pay for extra IPs and only turn one
computer at a time.
<P>3) Buy an expensive cable modem that's also a NAT router.  You'll shell out
700 or 800 dollars for one of these.  You can have as many computers 
connected as you want, but you still need a hub and network cards for all
your computers.
<P>4) Buy a NAT router for ethernet.  Don't know what these c
ost.  You'll still need the hub and the network cards.
<P>5) Build yourself a NAT router out of an old linux box.  You'll need TWO
network cards for the "Linux NAT box", plus the hub, plus network cards for all
your other machines.  You get all of the advantages of an expensive NAT router,
but you get to(have to) build and configure it yourself.  
<P>The last way is the way I'm going.. and I'm doing it all with the
Linux Router Project 1 disk distribution of Linux.  I plan to post
more details once it's entirely up and running.
<P>BTW your 386 is below what I'd recommend for a NAT router, but it will
work.  I'd say get a 486/66.  I've seen that recommend ed in the LRP
doc's too, but they also say you can get buy with a 486/33.  You might as
well try the 386.. if it's fast enough for you, then you are all set.
<P>More info on the LRP is at: www.linuxrouter.org
More info about NAT routing under linux is in the IP Masquarading HOWTO
