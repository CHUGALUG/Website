<h3>About The Meetings</h3>
Meetings occur on the first Wednesday of each month from 8-9:30 PM and are held at <a href="/map.php">Free IT Athens</a>.  Please join the Facebook group (link above) or the Mailing list (link at left in sidebar) if you would like to join discussions about the meetings.  See below for general notes about the meetings.
<br></br>
Frita Noob-Hour presentations will occur before the CHUGALUG meeting, at 7 PM, at Free I. T. Athens,  on most meeting days.  They will last a half-hour to 45 minutes.  They will cover topics relevant to the CHUGALUG meeting, but are designed for those very new to the topics.
<br></br>
If you would like to help out during Free IT Athens' open hours (great fun and experience introducing new people to Linux!), you need only attend their very helpful and low-stress new volunteer orientation.  <a href="http://www.freeitathens.org/get_involved/">Click here to learn more about becoming a volunteer at Free IT Athens</a>.

<h3>This Month's Meeting</h3>
<b>Regular Meeting - Topic: Graphics</b>
<br></br>
Wed., 1 February, 2017, 8 - 9:30 PM
</br>
Everyone!
<br></br>
There isn't a speaker or a specific format.  This is just a
suggested topic based on the Noob-Hour before the meeting. 
There are no requirements to stay on topic or to deviate
from it.  If you know about 
graphics capabilities in GNU/Linux, 
come share your knowledge.  If you don't, then come and learn!

<h3>General notes about meetings</h3>
Frita open hours are from 6-8 PM. Feel free to show up in that window if you want to check them out. The meeting opens at 8 PM, but actually begins at 8:15 (this allows the Frita staff to close down from open hours).  If there is a presentation, it will begin promptly at 8:15 and should take about an hour.  Questions during the presentation are encouraged.  The meeting ends at 9:30.
