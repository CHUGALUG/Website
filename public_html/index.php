If you would like to help out during Free IT Athens' open hours (great fun and experience introducing new people to Linux!), you need only attend their very helpful and low-stress new volunteer orientation.  <a href="http://www.freeitathens.org/get_involved/">Click here to learn more about becoming a volunteer at Free IT Athens</a>.

<h3>General notes about meetings</h3>
Frita open hours are from 6-8 PM. Feel free to show up in that window if you want to check them out. The meeting opens at 8 PM, but actually begins at 8:15 (this allows the Frita staff to close down from open hours).  If there is a presentation, it will begin promptly at 8:15 and should take about an hour.  Questions during the presentation are encouraged.  The meeting ends at 9:30.
