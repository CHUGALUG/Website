<h3>About The Meetings</h3>
Meetings occur on the first Wednesday of each month from 8-9:30 PM and are held at <a href="/map.php">Free IT Athens</a>.  Please join the Facebook group (link above) or the Mailing list (link at left in sidebar) if you would like to join discussions about the meetings.  See below for general notes about the meetings.
<br></br>
Frita Noob-Hour presentations sometimes occur a week or two before the CHUGALUG meeting, at 7 PM, at Free I. T. Athens.  They will last a half-hour to 45 minutes.  They will cover topics relevant to the CHUGALUG meeting, but are designed for those very new to the topics.
<br></br>
If you would like to help out during Free IT Athens' open hours (great fun and experience introducing new people to Linux!), you need only attend their very helpful and low-stress new volunteer orientation.  <a href="http://www.freeitathens.org/get_involved/">Click here to learn more about becoming a volunteer at Free IT Athens</a>.
<br></br>
<b>New! We're trying streaming.</b>
Starting with this meeting, whenever we have a presentation, we will attempt to
stream the presentation on YouTube.  This is a new thing for us, so we would 
love it if you would try it out and give us feedback.

<h3>This Month's Meeting</h3>
<b>Source Code As Product</b>
<br></br>
Wed., 11 July, 2018, 8 - 9:30 PM
</br>
Lachele Foley
<br></br>
Most folks are familiar with 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software">apps</a>
and other types of 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software">software</a>.
Some will also be familiar with 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">
application programming interfaces (APIs)</a>, 
which facilitate the generation of new apps.
For one of my big projects, though, the source code itself is the product.  
The source does provide an API because it is built as a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)">software 
library</a>, but the real star is the code itself.
<br></br>
In this talk, I'll spend a little time explaining why someone might 
want to build source code as a product.  Then, I'll give an overview of
the particular projects 
(<a href="https://github.com/GLYCAM-Web/gems/tree/gems-dev">GEMS</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/GLYCAM-Web/gmml/tree/gmml-dev">GMML</a>), 
and show how we use them to build a website (see 
<a href="https://dev.glycam.org/">development</a> and/or
<a href="http://glycam.org/">production</a> versions).
Finally, I'll spend some time talking about how hard it can be to
undertake a project like this.  
I'll also show how open source software, particularly
GNU/Linux, fuels the entire endeavor.
</p><p>
We'll plan on streaming again, so drop by 
youtube if you can't make it in person.

<h3>General notes about meetings</h3>
Frita open hours are from 6-8 PM. Feel free to show up in that window if you want to check them out. The meeting opens at 8 PM, but actually begins at 8:15 (this allows the Frita staff to close down from open hours).  If there is a presentation, it will begin promptly at 8:15 and should take about an hour.  Questions during the presentation are encouraged.  The meeting ends at 9:30.
